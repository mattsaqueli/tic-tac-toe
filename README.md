## Abstract:
Are you waiting to be seated at a restaurant? In line at an amusement park for a roller coaster? Don't worry, a classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe can pass the time!

## Installation Instructions:

- Fork this repository to your GitHub account.
- In your forked GitHub repository, click the code drop-down menu and copy the SSH key.

**Option 1**

Open the terminal on your machine and navigate to the containing directory you’d like - to clone the repository folder and its contents to.
On the command line, run “git clone” + the SSH key you copied earlier.
A new folder will be created containing a local copy of the repository linked to the forked repository you created - enter the new directory.
On the command line, run “open index.html”.

**Option 2**

In the forked repository you created, open the “Settings” tab and select “Pages” on the left pane.
Under “Build and Deployment”, select “Deploy from a Branch” within the “Source” drop-down menu.
Under “Branch”, select the “main” branch in the drop-down menu and hit the “Save” button.
On the right-hand side of the main page of your repository, find the “Environments” section and click the link for “github-pages” - this may take some time to load at first.
In the following page, hit the “View Deployment” button to view the site.

## Context:

I completed this game as part of my final project of module one coursework for the Turing School of Software and Design Front End Web Development program, a four module, seven month focused on preparing students for a career as web developers working with Javascript, HTML, CSS, and the React framework. This project was completed over the course of seven days in line with the project specification and rubric detailed [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-1/tic-tac-toe-solo-v2.html). The goal of this project was to build a fully functioning Tic-Tac-Toe game, with well-organized HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## Learning Goals:

The primary goals of this project were to integrate clear understanding of HTML, CSS, and Javascript code. The secondary goal was to create a fully-functional application that met all of the project requirements in terms of usability. 

## Wins + Challenges:

Challenge:
One of my main challenges was reaching a solution with the logic behind a Tic-Tac-Toe game. My first approach made it difficult for me to follow along with my own code to keep everything in order. After I asked one of my mentors for feedback, the advice I received helped me refactor my code which made the thought process a bit easier. 

Win:
One of my main wins was refactoring pieces of the code as I'm completing each function, that made it less difficult for me to adjust anything if needed. Another win for me was my approach of naming each variable/function.
